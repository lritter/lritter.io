# Previously

Like [now](https://lritter.io/now) but before...

## What I’ve read

I've tried to keep track of what I've read but it gets a little fuzzy the further you go back... I know that I've read other stuff but I'm not sure exactly when.

### September, 2024

- _[The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store](https://www.jamesmcbride.com/heaven-earth/)_ by [James McBride](https://www.jamesmcbride.com)

  I loved how this came together at the end. The whole thing reminded me of "A Gentleman in Moscow" in a way I can't quite put my finger on.

### August, 2024

- _[The Mercy of Gods](https://www.jamessacorey.com/books/the-mercy-of-gods/)_ by [James S.A. Corey](https://www.jamessacorey.com)

  Really excited for this new series.

- _[On Writing](https://stephenking.com/works/nonfiction/on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft.html)_ by [Stephen King](https://stephenking.com)

  Like most books, I listened to this one. I absolutely loved listening to Stephen King read it.

- _[Sand](https://hughhowey.com/books/sand/)_ by [Hugh Howey](https://hughhowey.com)

  I really enjoy the "Silo" series as well as his short story collection, Machine Learning, and this didn't dissapoint. I'm eager to get more into this world.

- _Space Force_, Jeremy Robinson

### July, 2024

- _[My Brialliant Friend](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend)_ by [Elena Ferrante](https://elenaferrante.com)

  I'm trying to broaded what I read. This was beautiful. Some of my friends describe the feeling of not being able to put this book down. I didn't feel that way but I loved the writing.

- _[The Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road)_ by [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy)

  I can't believe it took me so long to read this. The contrast between the stripped down dialog and the ornate descriptions of the rest of the world is really fascinating and compelling.

- _Never Let Me Go_, Kazuo Ishiguro

  I liked this but the few reviews I read described this as "genre bending" and I have to say that despite there being some speculative fiction elements, I don't think that's enough to make it bend any genres.

### June, 2024

- _[Generation Ship](https://www.michaelmammay.com/books/generation-ship/)_ by [Michael Mammay](https://www.michaelmammay.com)

  A bit different than the Planet/Space/Coloney-side series. Seems like not everyone liked the departure but I was into it.

- _[Service Mode](https://adriantchaikovsky.com/stand-alone-novels.html#anchor6)_ by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://adriantchaikovsky.com/) {book}

  I like this one. It's a more cerebral Murder Bot.

- _The Terraformers_ by Annalee Newitz

  It's fun to think about generation-spanning stories like this one. I wish I had a better imagination for how cultures might grow and evolve when oriented around specific values or goals.

### February, 2024

- _Wayward: Wanderers, Book 2_ by Chuck Wendig

  I didn't like this quite as much as the first one but it was well worth the time.
