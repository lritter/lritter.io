### What Iâ€™ve read

- [Service Mode](https://adriantchaikovsky.com/stand-alone-novels.html#anchor6) by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://adriantchaikovsky.com/) {book}

  I like this one. It's a more cerebral Murder Bot.

- [The Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road) by [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy)

  I can't believe it took me so long to read this. The contrast between the stripped down dialog and the ornate descriptions of the rest of the world is really fascinating and compelling.

- [My Brialliant Friend](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend) by [Elena Ferrante](https://elenaferrante.com)

  I'm trying to broaded what I read. This was beautiful. Some of my friends describe the feeling of not being able to put this book down. I didn't feel that way but I loved the writing.

- [Sand](https://hughhowey.com/books/sand/) by [Hugh Howey](https://hughhowey.com)

  I really enjoy the "Silo" series as well as his short story collection, Machine Learning, and this didn't dissapoint. I'm eager to get more into this world.
