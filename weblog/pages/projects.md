## Dotfiles

I host all my [dotfiles on github](https://github.com/lritter/dotfiles). Some of
the interesting functions are those for [setting up GitHub tokens](https://github.com/lritter/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/setup_github_security_token.sh)
(or similar) and [putting them into the environment](https://github.com/lritter/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/bash_env#L68)
using macOS Keychain. This helps keep sensitive information out of dotfiles.

## Ancient History

Here are some of my favorite projects from the ancient past.

### Loud Networks

As a class project for CSE 561 (Fall 2005) our team built a full wireless
network stack using sound as the transmission  medium. We were able to achieve
reliable communication at distances of up to 15 feet in noisy environments at
160 bits per second. We were able to maintain 50% medium usage under high load
using our novel congestion control mechanism.
